# React Creative Starter

This template is tailored for creative React projects. It ships with Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, SVGR, and TSConfig path aliases out of the box.

Note: The project generator overwrites this README with a customized version that reflects the stack you select (animation/state/3D/creative). This file serves as a generic fallback.

## Features

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS preconfigured
- SVGR for importing SVGs as React components
- TSConfig paths alias (`@/*`)

## Getting Started
